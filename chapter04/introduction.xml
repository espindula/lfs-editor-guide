  <para>Here is a summary list of things to do before committing changes:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Test the instructions you are adding.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Update <filename>general.ent</filename> with the new date.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><para>Update <filename>chapter01/changelog.xml.</filename></para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><para>Check that all relevant files have been
      <userinput>git add</userinput>'d or <userinput>git rm</userinput>'d.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><para>Check the validity of the XML.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Check that the book renders properly.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Commit; go back to the beginning if you have another set
    of changes you want to make.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Push once you are done with all your changes.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Update trac to reflect the changes.</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>You should normally restrict a commit to one set of changes, so if
    you are updating the versions of three packages you will usually do that in
    three separate commits.  Clearly, what forms a "set" is a matter
    for your judgement. Always think that a set will have to be merged to (at
    least) the
    multilib branch. Pushing is not mandatory after each change if you plan
    to soon make another one. Once again, it is advised to run
    <userinput>git pull</userinput> before pushing in order to resolve
    any conflict locally.
  </para>

  <para>
    The editors of the LFS book prefer that changes to the date in
    general.ent are made as part of a <emphasis>real</emphasis> change.
