  <para>
    If you are adding files, you need to run a <command>git add</command>
    command on each of them. When you remove files, you should always do that
    with <command>git rm</command>. Moving or renaming files is done with
    <command>git mv</command>. Adding a directory and all its children is
    done with <command>git add &lt;dirname&gt;</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
    If you think you're ready to commit, run <command>git status</command>
    to see the state of the working copy. The normal process is to first
    <command>git add</command> the files that are modified to the index, then
    run <command>git commit</command> to store the set of changes into the
    local repository. The ouput of git status looks like this:

<screen>On branch trunk
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/trunk'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
        modified:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   TODO</screen>

  <para>
    where the "Changes to be committed" appear in green, while the
    "Changes not staged for commit" appear in red.
