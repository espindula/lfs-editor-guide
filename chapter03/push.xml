  <para><userinput>git push</userinput>.
    This command synchronizes the public repository on the server with
    your local one. You should make sure you want to publish all the commits
    you have done. Sometimes, it may be useful to run
    <userinput>git rebase -i</userinput> in order to simplify the history.
    Also, to prevent conflicts when pusshing, it is better to use first
    <userinput>git pull</userinput> prior to pushing, and resolve the
    conflicts locally.
