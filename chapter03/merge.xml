    This is useful to apply changes from another branch (or several branches)
    to the current one. By default the resulting changes are committed. This
    can be prevented with the <option>--no-commit</option> option, which
    allows to review the changes, and possibly reset some of them.

  <para>
    In some cases, merging results in conflicts that have to be manually
    resolved. Note that it is recommended to merge only to a clean branch,
    that is after committing all changes.

    <title>Note to Subversion Users</title>

    <para>
      Contrary to subversion, there is no <option>--dry-run</option> option
      to <userinput>git merge</userinput>. But a repository can always be
      reset to a previous state with
      <userinput>git reset --hard &lt;commit&gt;</userinput>.
