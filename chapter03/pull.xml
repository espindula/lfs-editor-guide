  <para><userinput>git pull</userinput>.
    This command synchronizes your local repository.
    If you have made local changes, Git will try to
    merge any changes on the server with the changes you have committed
    <emphasis>on your machine</emphasis>. If the changes on the server overlap
    with local uncommitted changes, the merge is cancelled, and the work tree
    will remain untouched.
  </para>

  <para>Unlike <command>svn <option>up</option></command>, when Git merges
  your local commits with the changes on the server, it will produce a
  merge commit.  Too many merge commits may cause the history to be
  confusing.  As an alternative, one can pass <option>--rebase</option> to
  <command>git <option>pull</option></command>, telling Git to rebase your
  local commits onto the changes on the server.  Read
  <xref linkend="ch03-rebase"/> for the details about rebasing.</para>

  <para>To make a clean history, editors should use rebasing instead of
  merging for synchronizing the changes on the server if you have some
  local commits.  To make <option>--rebase</option> the default for
  <command>git pull</command>, issue:
  <command>git config pull.rebase true</command>.</para>

  <para>You should always do a manual <command>git <option>pull</option>
    </command> before trying to push changes in order to ensure that there are
    no conflicts with changes that have been made since you started your work.
    Note that <command>git <option>push</option></command> will warn you if
    there is a conflict and you forget to perform a <command>git
    <option>pull</option></command>.
  </para>
