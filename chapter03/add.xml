  <para>
    <userinput>git add [<replaceable>modified-files</replaceable>]</userinput>.
    This stages the modifications to all the <filename>modified-files</filename>
    (including newly created files) to the index. If you specify a directory
    in <filename>modified-files</filename>, all the files modified in this
    directory or its subdirectories are staged. The change is not in
    the local repository until you do a <userinput>git commit</userinput>.
    We will touch on this more as we continue in the chapter.
  </para>

  <para>
    This command can be used in a very flexible way by using the
    <option>-p</option> option. You can select each hunk of the diff that
    is staged into the index. This allows testing a full change and then divides
    commits into small <quote>atomic</quote> pieces that are easier to review
    and understand.
