  <para>
    <userinput>git add [<replaceable>modified-file]</replaceable></userinput>.
    This stages the modifications to all the <filename>modified-files</filename>
    (including creating the files) to the index. The default if
    <filename>modified-files</filename> is not specified is to stage all the
    modified files in the tree, but not the created ones. The change is not in
    the local repository until you do a <userinput>git commit</userinput>.
    We'll touch on this more as we continue in the chapter.
  </para>

  <para>
    This command can be used in a very flexible way by using the
    <option>-p</option> option. You can select each hunk of the diff that
    is staged into the index. This allows to test a full change, then divide
    commits into small <quote>atomic</quote> pieces that are easier to review
    and/or understand.
