  <para><userinput>git rebase</userinput>
    This is useful to have the current branch start from another point in
    the history. For example if you have:
  </para>

<screen><literal>                              B1---B2---B3    my_branch
                             /
                            A---C1---C2       trunk
</literal></screen>
  <para>
    rebasing my_branch onto trunk will produce:
  </para>

<screen><literal>                              B'1---B'2---B'3 my_branch
                             /
                   A---C1---C2                trunk
</literal></screen>

  <para>
    where the state reached after commit B'3 is the same as it was at B3.
  </para>

  <para>
    But the most useful command is <userinput>git rebase -i</userinput>
    that allows you to rewrite history when you have made messy commits.
  </para>
