  <para>Let's get familiar with the basic set of commands which all editors will
    use on an almost daily basis. There are many more options available than the
    ones listed here, so you will want to read the Git documentation
    (<ulink url="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</ulink>) at some
    point.
    <command>git <option>help</option></command> also provides a useful quick
    reference for Git commands. Sometimes <command>git status</command> shows
    a couple of commands that an user might want to run in the current
    state of the repository.

    <para>
      As already said, the Git repository is on the local machine. More
      precisely, the directory holds a working copy of some branch
      of the repository, and the repository itself is stored under the
      <filename class="directory">.git</filename> directory along with various
      configuration settings. The command <xref linkend="ch03-checkout"/>
      is used to switch branches.
    </para>

    <para>
      In addition to the local repository, git maintains a staging area
      that is known as the index. The command <xref linkend="ch03-add"/>
      populates that staging area and <xref linkend="ch03-commit"/> is
      used transfer the content of the index to the repository. This
      allows for a fine control of what is committed, but several
      shortcuts can be taken. Contrary to subversion,
      <command>git add</command> is not only be used to add files, but also
      to store modifications to the existing files.
