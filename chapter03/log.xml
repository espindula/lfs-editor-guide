  <para><userinput>git log</userinput>.
    Outputs the commit log of the branch currently in the working
    directory. Various options allow to customize the level of
    information given for each commit. It is strongly advised to run this
    command before pushing to the remote repository, or merging. If the
    history is too convoluted, it may be necessary to run
    <xref linkend="ch03-rebase"/> in order to simplify it. Your co-editors will
    hate you if you change the history after pushing it.

    <para>
      The ouput is automatically passed to a pager, so that it is not necessary
      to pipe it to <command>less</command>. Furthermore, no access to the
      remote repository is needed, so it is ususally much faster to get a
      long log.
