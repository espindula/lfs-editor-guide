  <title>Advisories since the last release.</title>
  <?dbhtml filename="since-last-release.html"?>

  <para>
    There are separate pages for LFS and BLFS where we list our advisories
    since our last release. These pages are in alphabetical order, with
    newer advisories coming before older ones for the same package.
  </para>

  <para>
    In both LFS and BLFS the page is labelled with the number of our current
    release, so 10.1.html from March 2021 until we release our next version.
  </para>

  <para>
    You will see there is a commented &lt;h3&gt;PackageName&lt;h3&gt; as a guide.
    The &lt;h4&gt; line should be copied from the entry you created in
    <filename>consolidated.html</filename>. Follow that with a short paragraph
    summarising the problem and how to fix it (or in exceptional cases other
    actions to work around the problem). Add a sentence linking to the
    advisory in <filename>consolidated.html</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Some packages get extra information, e.g. Thunderbird has an italic paragraph
    explaining how the vulnerabilities are in a browser-like context. If this is
    the first advisory for Thunderbird in this release, copy that part from the
    previous advisories. Similarly, in LFS glibc gets different information
    because the only supported upgrade path in LFS is to build a new LFS: give
    information to let users decide how serious the vulnerabilit{y,ies} is/are
    for their use-case (many are quite old).
