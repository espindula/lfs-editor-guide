    When a new release of the books is ready (i.e. the new book directories for
    this version have been populated), there are notes in the
    <filename>Notes-re-release.txt</filename> files:

    As well as updating <filename>index.html</filename> for the new release,
    and creating a new page for the new version - initially stating "There are
    no known security vulnerabilities" - the advisories for what is now the
    previous release need to be amended.

  <para>
    That is because the packages in that release have been tested up to the
    versions and packages in that release, and from time to time packages will
    later drop out, or be replaced by forked versions, or even move to a
    different part of the book. So the links should be changed so that instead
    of pointing to the development book, they now point to the version we have
    just released.
