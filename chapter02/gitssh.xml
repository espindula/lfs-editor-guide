<title>Git SSH Access (for editors)</title>
<?dbhtml filename="gitssh.html"?>

<para>For editors, access is slightly more complicated. You first of all need
to generate an ssh key-pair. You then need to upload your public key into your
<filename>~/.ssh</filename> directory on rivendell. To generate the keys run:
</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ssh-keygen -t ed25519</userinput></screen></para>

<para>When prompted as to where to save them, it's probably best to leave
them in .ssh (as <filename>id_ed25519</filename> and
<filename>id_ed25519.pub</filename>) unless you already have ssh keys there.
When prompted for a passphrase just press enter (unless you want to have
to give the phrase <emphasis>every</emphasis> time you synchronize to the
server.  But, since the same passphrase will be used when you log in to
<emphasis>rivendell</emphasis> over ssh, it may be advisable to have some
security in place.) Having generated your keys, send the
<filename>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</filename> to an administrator on rivendell,
in order to have it added to
<filename>~git/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> <emphasis>on
rivendell</emphasis>.  (Your local copy of <filename>id_ed25519</filename>
and <filename>id_ed25519.pub</filename> should remain untouched by
this.) The same key may be used to connect without a password to rivendell.
Upload <filename>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</filename> to
<filename>.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> in your home on rivendell, and
make sure that the ~/.ssh directory on rivendell is mode 700:</para>

<screen><userinput>chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh</userinput></screen>

<para>Once you have this setup, try to checkout the latest LFS book revision by
running (from your local machine):</para>

<screen><userinput>git clone git@git.linuxfromscratch.org:lfs.git lfsbook</userinput></screen>

<para>If this works, you'll download a copy of the current repository to
<filename class="directory">lfsbook/.git</filename> and you will check out
the default branch, which is named <emphasis>trunk</emphasis> in LFS. You
will also have write access so from now on be extra
careful, but note that <emphasis>no</emphasis> changes will be made until you
issue a <userinput>git push</userinput> command.</para>

<para>The above is fine for getting the default branch, but you may
want to work on a different public branch. To set up a local branch that tracks
a public branch named <emphasis>new_branch</emphasis>, just issue:</para>

<screen><userinput>git checkout --track origin/<replaceable>&lt;new_branch&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

<note>
<title>Note to Subversion Users</title>
<para>Contrary to Subversion, where you need to check out a new working
copy of the remote branch, with Git almost nothing is downloaded.
The local directory now reflects the new branch, but the old branch directory
does not exist anymore.</para>
</note>

<para>
If you need to work on the default branch named <emphasis>trunk</emphasis>,
just commit your changes (if any) to the new branch (the commit is local),
and switch back to trunk with:
</para>

<screen><userinput>git checkout trunk</userinput></screen>

<para>
Since the new branch is already set up, if you want again to work on the new
branch, just do:
</para>

<screen><userinput>git checkout <replaceable>&lt;new_branch&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

<para>As with anonymous access, you can update your local repository by simply
<command>cd</command>'ing into the LFS directory and running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>git pull</userinput></screen></para>
