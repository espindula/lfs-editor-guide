      <title>LFS - Multilib version</title>

      <para>
        There is a special branch of the LFS book which includes
        additional instructions for those users who like to build a 
        system which supports 32bit binaries and not only 64bit.
        For more details about how and why, refer to that book, here
        only the parameters required to build the ML book are
        discussed.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In order to use the multilib version of the book, the
        repository must be switched to the branch <literal>multilib</literal>
        by using git:
      </para>
      
<screen><userinput>git checkout multilib</userinput></screen>

      <para>
        To control if and which multilib version of the book will be
        created, use the ARCH parameter.
      </para>
      
<screen><userinput>make ARCH=ml_32</userinput></screen>

      <para>
        Possible values for ARCH are
        <literal>ml_32</literal> to include instructions to support
        the m32 binaries or <literal>ml_x32</literal> for the mx32
        architecture. <literal>ml_default</literal> which is used when
        ARCH is not given, includes none of the additional instructions
        and the resulting book is nearly identical to the book when
        the <literal>trunk</literal> branch is used. <literal>ml_all</literal>
        includes both <literal>ml_32</literal> and <literal>ml_x32</literal>
        instructions.
